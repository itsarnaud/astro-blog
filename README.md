# Astro Project â€” Personal Learning

This is a personal learning project I created to start getting hands-on with Astro.js.
It provides a minimal base to explore static page creation and the use of Astro/JSX
components in a simple setup.

My goal is to get familiar with the project structure, file-based routing, and the core
CLI commands.

## Live demo

The project is deployed here: [https://astro-demo-1234.netlify.app/](https://astro-demo-1234.netlify.app/)

## Quick setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Useful commands (run from the project root)

```sh
npm run dev      # start the dev server (default: http://localhost:4321)
npm run build    # build the production site into ./dist
npm run preview  # preview the built site locally
npm run astro -- --help  # help for Astro CLI commands
```

## Project structure

Important files live under `src/`:

- `src/pages/` : pages and routes (files with `.astro` or `.md`)
- `src/components/` : reusable components (Astro, React, etc.)
- `layouts/` : page layouts
- `public/` : static assets (images, favicon...)

Resources

- Astro documentation: [https://docs.astro.build](https://docs.astro.build)

## Notes

This README is intentionally minimal and focused on the personal learning goal of this
project: getting started with Astro.js. Feel free to modify, extend pages, and add
components to deepen the learning.
